Looking at the page source of our Acme IT Support website (http://10.10.220.151), you'll see a comment at the end of every page with a page load time and also a link to the framework's website, which is https://static-labs.tryhackme.cloud/sites/thm-web-framework. Let's take a look at that website. Viewing the documentation page gives us the path of the framework's administration portal, which gives us a flag if viewed on the Acme IT Support website.
Next, move on to the login page, which is the ACME website ip/thm-framework-login
